developing a big data platform using Scala, Python, Apache Hive, Hbase and HDFS, among other technologies. Matthieu
has a strong academic foundation in statistical analysis and modelling.

## Experience

### Data Engineer at Roke Manor Research Lld _(Nov 2017- Present)_

I started at Roke on the graduate development program, which I finished in November 2019 when I was promoted to a Data Engineer. During this time, I have been involved in the following:

Project supporting development of a Big Data Pipeline for use in the defence domain.
- Developed on a data pipeline using Apache Nifi and Kafka to ingest data which is stored in Apache HBase and
then presented to the user with a GraphQL API via a Scala backend.
- Worked on customer site in a rainbow team alongside other contractors.
- Produced documentation and technical drawings in order to design solutions for the team to implement.
- Experienced working in an agile scrum environment and took a leading role in Agile scrum ceremonies; taking
the place of the scrum master when they were absent.
- Worked in a secured Linux development environment and with tools such as Jenkins, Docker, Ansible and
Python to administer development environments and drive continuous integration.
- Communicated with users and external stakeholders to explain the platform and support their integration to it.
- Provided support to colleagues on other software engineering tasks to automate the testing and deployment of
the platform.

Project providing test support to a database development project in the law enforcement domain.
- Generated test data for migration of and creation of a new law enforcement database
- Used Python, SQL and custom-made software to create a range of complex test data.
- Risk assessed migration from Microsoft SQLServer to PostgreSQL and produced documentation for the
customer on this.

Project conducting a capability assessment of open source methods for face recognition.
- Used image-processing and machine learning packages in Python such as sci-kit learn and opencv to identify
individuals from a single photo.
- Investigated and carried out web-scraping for labelled face images.

Project assisting a cyber vulnerability assessment in the automotive sector.
- Investigated the security of the internal network of a modern car.
- Collected, visualised and analysed bus network data.

Other work activity:
- Successfully supported bidding for a Defence and Security Accelerator project.
- Planned and delivered activities for STEM promotion events and school visits.
- Assisted with the organisation and running of workshops with defence stakeholders.

### Finance Intern at the University of Southampton _(Jun 2016 - Sep 2016)_

My primary role as an intern with the Professional Services Finance Department at the University of Southampton
was to prepare a data set for benchmarking analysis. In doing so, I built on the following skills:
- Technical knowledge
o Used Microsoft Excel to manipulate hundreds of lines of data using functions such as SUMIF, COUNTIF,
VLOOKUP and others.
o Improved my ability to organise and analyse numerical data.
o Gained insight into business operations, finance and strategy within the university which can be applied
elsewhere.
- Project management
o Coordinated by email and in person with estates employees, managers, heads of faculty finance and other
accountants in order to collect data.
o Managed and instructed team members on how to prepare relevant data for submission to the dataset.
o Completed work to deadlines while also carrying out day to day accounting tasks with Agresso.
- Communicating Ideas
o Discussed with colleagues in order to overcome problems with the project.
o Used Pivot tables to summarise and present data clearly.

## Education

### BSc, Mathematics and Statistics, First Class Honours, University of Southampton 2014 - 2017

- Developed my coding skills with R, carrying out regression, factorial and survival analysis in order to complete
coursework.
- Built on my modelling skills, learning about the properties and applications of a range of statistical distributions in
order to select the most appropriate one for analysis.
- Strengthened my ability to analyse situations in a mathematical manner and break down problems into logical set
of steps in order to solve them.
- Group projects
o Used R for regression analysis on airline fares in order to assess the suitability of the model.
o Used Simul8 to solve a problem relating to queues in a call centre.
o Improved my skills in discussing mathematical concepts with my team.
o Collaborated to deliver high-scoring reports and presentations to academic staff and my peers.

### A levels at The Cherwell School, Oxford 2007 - 2014

Studied for A levels(grade) in French(B), Maths(A), Further Maths(B) and Geography(A), as well as AS levels in Physics(A), Biology(A) and
General Studies(A).
